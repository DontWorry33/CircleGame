	-	Reset kind of implemented. Not as I like it but it does the job for now. Press 'r' to reset game at any time.
	-	Anpan power basis works. Select anpan after shooting him and right click to swap places.
		- Also changed it so that when you right click, Baker is selected instead of Anpan after the swap

	- 	Added positionLock. This means we can not move baker until the trajectory is out of the air. This is not ideal but it will have to do for now.
	-	Powerbar only shows after you start pressing spacebar and stops showing when the thing you shot hits anything.

Complete revamp of Repository.
1. Character_Images:
	- Removed obsolete files
2. Coding
	- Got rid of folder “newcode”
	- All code files now directly accessible within “Coding”
	- Removed obsolete files
3. Noticeboard
	- New text file for logging any changes, as well as the intent for each change made.
4. Stage_Images
	- Created specific files for each Stage:
		• Stage1
		• Stage2
		• Stage3
		• Stage4
		• Stage5 (still empty)
		• Stage6 (still empty)

	- Created file for images that appear in all stages. Those images are:
		• Anpan_Selected.png
		• Boule_Selected.png
		• Portal_Anpan.png
		• Portal_Baker.png
		• Portal_Roti.png
		• Roti_Selected.png
		• Stage_NullSign.png
		• Stage_Oven_Default.png
		• Stage_Oven_Small.png
	- Created file for mapping of stages. Allows for unambiguous placement of all 
stage elements.
	- Created StageNotes.rtf, tells which switches activate which switches in the stage.
5. Text_Files
	- Bound_ReadMe.txt, talks about the premise of our game, “Bound”
	- Game_Bugs.txt, is where to jot down any addressable bugs. Also date when bugs were first encountered. (If one was unable to fix them in the same day the bug was discovered.
	- Todo_List.txt, still not sure if this is necessary. Remains for now.
6. Miscellaneous
	- Switches have been uniformly created. All stages have their specific switches within their “Stage” files.

BUG FIXES!
1) Fixed bug where sometimes the bread wouldn't shoot
2) Fixed bug where bread would bounce off surfaces
3) Fixed bug where swapping stages would crash

Started work on Stage Creation
1. Discovered some new issues.
    - Baker falls through the top stage parts of Stage2. (Might be other bread as well)
    - Clicking on Baker while Roti's power is active allows Baker to fly at will
2. Put in framerate cap, in Circle.cpp, so Xcode works.

11/17/14 (Dedie)
1. Updated Stage2 Horizontal Platforms. Hitbox was a tad too big. Trimmed.

11/28/14 (Dedie)
1. Updated bunch of things:
	- Stage5 and Stage6 have been fully uploaded. 
	- Updated the Grids pictures to show a visually mapping of switches to platforms.
	- StageNotes updated with the mappings for Stage5 and Stage6. As well as a definition of a Snap switch.
	- ReadMe updated to include the Boule’s power in a little bit more detail.
	- *Still have to update Portals. I’m not feeling the current design.
