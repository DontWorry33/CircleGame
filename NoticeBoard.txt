 - 07/26/14 (hussain):
	-	Reset kind of implemented. Not as I like it but it does the job for now. Press 'r' to reset game at any time.
	-	Anpan power basis works. Select anpan after shooting him and right click to swap places.
		- Also changed it so that when you right click, Baker is selected instead of Anpan after the swap

	- 	Added positionLock. This means we can not move baker until the trajectory is out of the air. This is not ideal but it will have to do for now.
	-	Powerbar only shows after you start pressing spacebar and stops showing when the thing you shot hits anything.

Complete revamp of Repository.
1. Character_Images:
	- Removed obsolete files
2. Coding
	- Got rid of folder “newcode”
	- All code files now directly accessible within “Coding”
	- Removed obsolete files
3. Noticeboard
	- New text file for logging any changes, as well as the intent for each change made.
4. Stage_Images
	- Created specific files for each Stage:
		• Stage1
		• Stage2
		• Stage3
		• Stage4
		• Stage5 (still empty)
		• Stage6 (still empty)

	- Created file for images that appear in all stages. Those images are:
		• Anpan_Selected.png
		• Boule_Selected.png
		• Portal_Anpan.png
		• Portal_Baker.png
		• Portal_Roti.png
		• Roti_Selected.png
		• Stage_NullSign.png
		• Stage_Oven_Default.png
		• Stage_Oven_Small.png
	- Created file for mapping of stages. Allows for unambiguous placement of all 
stage elements.
	- Created StageNotes.rtf, tells which switches activate which switches in the stage.
5. Text_Files
	- Bound_ReadMe.txt, talks about the premise of our game, “Bound”
	- Game_Bugs.txt, is where to jot down any addressable bugs. Also date when bugs were first encountered. (If one was unable to fix them in the same day the bug was discovered.
	- Todo_List.txt, still not sure if this is necessary. Remains for now.
6. Miscellaneous
	- Switches have been uniformly created. All stages have their specific switches within their “Stage” files.

BUG FIXES!
1) Fixed bug where sometimes the bread wouldn't shoot
2) Fixed bug where bread would bounce off surfaces
3) Fixed bug where swapping stages would crash

 - 11/14/14 (Dedie)
Started work on Stage Creation
1. Discovered some new issues.
    - Baker falls through the top stage parts of Stage2. (Might be other bread as well)
    - Clicking on Baker while Roti's power is active allows Baker to fly at will
2. Put in framerate cap, in Circle.cpp, so Xcode works.

 - 11/17/14 (Dedie)
1. Updated Stage2 Horizontal Platforms. Hitbox was a tad too big. Trimmed.

 - 11/28/14 (Dedie)
1. Updated bunch of things:
	- Stage5 and Stage6 have been fully uploaded. 
	- Updated the Grids pictures to show a visually mapping of switches to platforms.
	- StageNotes updated with the mappings for Stage5 and Stage6. As well as a definition of a Snap switch.
	- ReadMe updated to include the Boule’s power in a little bit more detail.
	- *Still have to update Portals. I’m not feeling the current design.

 - 12/09/14 (Dedie)
1. Updated Stage6 and Stage6_Boule. Now have zippers instead of odd ball thingies. And Stage6_Boule has motion blur to replicate sunlight. Looks awesome.

2. Updated Bound_ReadMe. Will need to touch up once I finalize the plot. Expect it to double in size when that happens. Also, Hussain, could you look into the ReadMe and update the notes. I started it off so you know what goes in there. Also, all characters are called by their official title within the ReadMe. So don’t go writing “Baker”.

3. Updated StageNotes.txt to include ‘The Box Formulae’ directly under Stage5, rather than have it tucked away in the ReadMe.

 - 12/13/14 (Dedie)
1. Modified ToDo_List.txt and Bound_ReadMe.txt. Now has what the hell Hussain has to do. And ReadMe now includes the types of switches.

 - 12/19/14 (Dedie)
1. Updated Portals.
2. Created the ‘Not-Created’ Error images

 - 12/20/14 (Dedie)
1. Stage3 updated
2. Grids updated
3. Screenshots updated
4. StageNotes updated
5. Stage1 updated

 - 12/25/14 (HUssain - I keep forgetting to use this so i'm gonna document whatever I remember since the last time)
1. All powers complete
2. Reset switches, displacement switches, stage removal switches, downwards movement stage switches all implemented, fixed many switch bugs (2 switches next to eachother)
3. Missing bread images when boule tries to walk into a portal is done. Appears in same location as the NullSign (0,0), we can change anytime
4. Baker now spawns at some point we have to declare in each stage. In Stage.cpp make sure to declare the baker start position in EACH STAGE like this:
        bakerStartPos.x = 500;
        bakerStartPos.y = 780;
5. All collision bugs should be fixed and collision should work flawlessly. Can add more collision points if neccessary (currently we are at 8, 5 for bottom region of circle, 1 for left, 1 for right, 1 for top)

    Happy New Year
1. Now then, on to business. I have implemented Stage1 to Stage4 for testing. *NOTE* I will need help to properly set all ground stage elements precisely on the floor, since my Mac doesn't show me the last few pixels on any stage.
2. Switch now has an added argument which changes the image of the switch called. Still looking for a ways to tell the switch which type of switch it is, so that the corresponding switch hit is also added.
3. Moving on, I have three main sections of observations started as I playtested each stage while implementing the parts. Here they are:

    • Bugs
        1. (On All Stages) The switch type 4 (the toggle switch that removes stage parts) only begins it's image swap on the second hit. In practice, what shows is the active switch, when the platform has been deactivated - and vice versa. Essentially, they represent the opposite of what they are doing.
        2. (On Stage3) I use only two portals. But when Boule goes through the Anpan switch, it comes out of 0,0 rather than the specified portal.
        3. (On Stage4) Baker and Bread are falling through the lines on this stage. Specifically quad1Hor4 and quad2Hor1. Will move up if that is the cheapest solution.
        4. (On All Stages) Roti, while its power is activated, can move DOWN through stages along with Baker. My suggestion is disabling the Down Movement entirely while the power is active.

    • Quality of Life
        1. I aim to make the Portals transparent-ish, and on the normal stages, so as to make it easier for players to see where the Portals are located without having to activate Boule's power. Will see if transparent switches also become necessity later on in the test cycle.
        2. Should also aim to make the power guage fill up at a faster rate. And maybe to clear itself after each shot, rather than holding on to the previous value for subsequent firings.
        3. I also aim to add an extra argument for the Oven, to choose between its Default and Small size, much like the switches.

	First update of the new year!

	Bug Fixes:
		1. Switch type 4 should now respond as it would normally.
		2. Portal bugs have been fixed, still need to implement the missing portal image, for now it uses the missing bread images.
		3. Should be fixed on my end. Was a collision/trajectory bug.
		4. Roti is being a real pain. Still looking into fixes for this.

	Quality of Life:
		2. Fixed second part which is where power guage resets after each shot.

    Alright, here's a thick one.
1. First up, I made large changes to Stage5 and Stage6. Their Grid and Screens have also been fittingly updated.
2. All Stages now have hints of how to progress in the form of Portals showing on both the normal stage and the boule-version of the stage. Figured it would make it easier to avoid right clicking straight into a portal and getting teleported away. I know that happened to me far too many times....
3. Stage3 had a bit of an err with its border. I cleaned that up good.
4. Lastly, I have found a more elegant way of implementing the last argument to Switch and Oven. Now, we can choose whether we want the large image, or the small image for each one.
5. Also, Switch Symbols have been added as a means of showing what the switch does before you hit it.
6. *NOTE* The Bug with the portals is still there. While I can now pass through Anpan and come out the portal, I can't seem to go through the portal to come back out of Anpan.
