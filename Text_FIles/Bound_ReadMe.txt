							Bound™

		Narrative

- PREMISE
	A broken promise has recently awakened. No clear memories of how or why it is here. Only a longing, to return home. For glory? Honour? Or just to say goodnight?


- PLOT
	A mother passes away. Leaving her four-year old son alone and wondering where she went. Even in another life, however, she does everything to return, and to say goodbye. As she promised to. 
These tulips she collects along the way are for exactly that reason. One reason. To kiss her baby and let him know it will all be okay.
 


		Gameplay

- CHARACTERS
	The Broken Promise: Main character. Silver rim with a cracked middle.
	The Dream: Second largest. Yellow rim, with a white band through it. 
	The Lie: Third largest character. Brown rim. With a purple shard at its centre.
	The Wish: Smallest. Red and blue. And most vital too.


- CHARACTER ABILITIES
	• The Broken Promise: No abilities. Must come in contact with the Tulips to progress. Can interact with all other characters to reach the Tulips.
	• The Dream: Magnetic. Can attract The Promise towards it and traverse vertical platforms that way. 
	• The Lie: Swaps places with The Promise. Permitted there’s enough room.
	• The Wish: May warp the stage into revealing switches and portals. These switches and portals are necessary to reach and activate platforms to progress. And The Wish is the only one to do it.


- OBJECTIVE
	The main objective is to use the various powers of the smaller characters to aid The Broken Promise in reaching the Tulips. Once a Tulip is reached on any stage, the level is completed. 
	If all characters have been fired, and no further viable moves present themselves, player can restart and try again.
