Values of collision points on stage.

Portal Box:
	- Right = x value = 235
	- Top = y value= 432

Line:
	- Left = x value = 568
	- Top = y value = 402
	- Right = x value = 590



This is what the stage is. (0,0) is the top left, (800,600) is the bottom right of the window.

							0,0                              800,0





							0,600                            800,600


//sets the radius of the circle.
Circle radius = 15

******FROM NOW OWN, CIRCLE WILL BE REFERED TO AS C OR CIRCLE.*********

//sets the center point of circle to middle so we can have proper rotations.
Circle.center.x = 15;
Circle.center.y = 15;


Top Left of Circle:(0,0)
Top Right of Circle:(30,0)
Bottom Left of Circle:(0,30)
Bottom Right of Circle:(30,30)




C.x - C.center.x = middle left of circle
C.x - C.center.x && C.y - C.center.y = top left of circle
C.x - C.center.x && C.y + C.center.y = bottom left of circle

C.x + C.center.x = middle right of circle
C.x + C.center.x && C.y - C.center.y = top right of circle
C.x + C.center.x && C.y + C.center.y = bottom right of circle




To fix collisions:

For moving left just check if the top left, bottom left of circle are hitting any collision points.
For moving right check top right, bottom right of circle are hitting any collision points
For moving up, check top right, top left of circle are hitting any collision points
FOr moving down, check bottom right, bottom left of circle are hitting any collision points
