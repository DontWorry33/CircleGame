Anpan Swap with Baker:


1)

	PROBLEM: If Baker swaps with small bread on top of a stage platform, Baker will fall through
	REASON: Due to collision check only checking so much of the stage part, when it swaps, baker will techincally be "in" the stage platform and fall.
	FIX: Modify collision to check "more" of the stage
	FIX(2): Modify Baker position after swap to set a few px above
	FIX(3): Determine if bread being swapped is on stage part, if so, set baker x Position to the swapped, y to on top of stage part.
	FIX(4): Check size difference between Baker and the bread it is swapping to (Anpan). Reposition accordingly.


2)
	
	PROBLEM: If Baker swaps with any bread within an area only the bread can fit in, Baker will be stuck.
	REASON: There will be stage parts touching the baker causing the Baker not being able to fit.
	FIX: Before the swap, check if ebounds of Baker and Ebounds+size of Baker are touching any stage part. If so, error so we can draw a NULL sign in game meaning can't swap.




Thoughts:
	Stage platform raising:
		- If setSubRect() actually cuts the entire texture in sub-rectangles no bugs will occur, it will show as if Baker is being raised on the platform
		
		- However, if setSubRect() just displays the sub-rect and doesn't cut the texture, it will show Baker on a invisibile platform as it rises and once it reahces the top, Baker will show to be on top of it.
