Try to make all blocks in stage an entity, so that collisions are much easier to handle as we create more stages in the game. - Later project.

PROGRAMMING (NIKHIL)
	- Install SFML 
	- Get C++ working with a compiler (*)
	- Compile a program in SFML
	- GET FAMILIAR! (*)
	- Go through source code and see what we've done, figure out why/how
	- trajectory of projectiles shooting from arrow, basic idea
