Try to make all blocks in stage an entity, so that collisions are much easier to handle as we create more stages in the game. - Later project.

FOURTH:	
	- Bread only shows AFTER space is released.
	- Trajectory occurs on all three breads
	- 


DESIGN (DEDIE):
	- 4 circle types  (*)
	- Indicator Arrow  (*)
	- Sample stage/design (in code) (*)
	- Power Bar (*)
	- Learn what a makefile does/is (*)
	- Update arrow  (*)
	- Start learning SFML  (*)
	- Trajectory in game (*)
	- Look into entity to entity collisions (*)
	- Change objects on map to seperate ones (*)
	- Stop trajectory of bread after coming into contact (*)
	- Design portal and teleportations paths


PROGRAMMING (NIKHIL)
	- Go through source code and see what we've done, figure out why/how 
	- Install SFML (*)
	- Get C++ working with a compiler (*)
	- Compile a program in SFML (*)
	- GET FAMILIAR! (*)
	- trajectory of projectiles shooting from arrow, basic idea (*)
	- Look into particle collisions
	- Keep learning C++/SFML


PROGRAMMING (HUSSAIN)    ***********//COMMENT ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL THE CODE//************
	- STAGE PROPERTIES (circle, collisions) (*)
	- Moving cursor (360 degrees) with mouse (*)
	- Basic game outline.  (*)
	- Gravity (*)
	- Switching (*)
	- Entities (*)
	- Entity to Entity collisions (*)
	- Polish trajectory (*)
	- Make all objects dynamic on map. (*)
	- Figure when bread collides with entity, why random collision
	- Fix collisions
