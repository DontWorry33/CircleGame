Try to make all blocks in stage an entity, so that collisions are much easier to handle as we create more stages in the game. - Later project.

	- Indicator Arrow  (*)
	- Sample stage/design (in code) (*)
	- Power Bar (*)
	- Learn what a makefile does/is (*)
	- Update arrow  (*)
	- Start learning SFML  (*)
	- Trajectory in game
	- Design portal and teleportations paths
	- Look into entity to entity collisions
	- Change objects on map to seperate ones


PROGRAMMING (NIKHIL)
	- Go through source code and see what we've done, figure out why/how 
	- Install SFML (*)
	- Get C++ working with a compiler (*)
	- Compile a program in SFML (*)
	- GET FAMILIAR! (*)
	- trajectory of projectiles shooting from arrow, basic idea (*)
	- Look into particle collisions
	- Keep learning C++/SFML


PROGRAMMING (HUSSAIN)    ***********//COMMENT ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL THE CODE//************
